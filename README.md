# ValorantApp

- I have created a valorant app that shows valorant characters and their information.
It retrieves all information unofficial valorant api. That is why there are some problems
with api data.It is returning some of the object as null and missing.
In app there are bundles and their information as well.It is coded with clean architecture
that has a lot of libraries and component.

**Tools that I used** :

- Navigation Component
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Retrofit 
- Postman for Api testing.
- Coroutines
- Livedata.
- View Binding
- Glide for image loading
- RESTApi
- LottieAnimationView

**Arhictecture:**

- MVVM
